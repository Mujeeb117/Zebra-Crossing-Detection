# Zebra-Crossing-Detection
A Zebra-Crossing-Detection that locates the zebra crossing in an image and draws a bounding rectangle around it while counting the number of white strips.

# Requirements
OpenCV
Numpy

# Usage
1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine
2. Run the code using a Python environment with the above dependencies installed.
3. The program will prompt you to enter the path of the image you want to process.
4. The program will display the original image, the image with the zebra crossing detected, and the count of white strips in the zebra crossing.

# Note
The code has been tested on images of zebra crossings with clear contrast between the white stripes and the black background. The accuracy may vary on images with different lighting conditions or different contrasts.
